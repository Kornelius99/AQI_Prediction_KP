Title: Air Quality Index Prediction By applying Machine Learning Procedures

Abstract:

Nowadays we can see the high air pollution in Metropolitan areas due to the heavy crowd staying, this is a serious issue. ozone, carbon-monoxide, nitrogen-oxide, sulphur-dioxide, particulate matter (2.5 & 1.0), and particulate matter-PM10 are causing polluting air, and it is released by actions done by people, fuel use, power & transportation. we use these molecules to identify the air quality index, to get this will use machine learning.
Most companies have started this process to help the environment. Machine Learning is the field to collect data from available sources and give the required output. In this paper, I have chosen this process to predict and forecast air quality values. Mainly I have used the supervised models for prediction, and time series model (prophet) used for forecasting. Linear-regression, Decision Tree, XG-Boost, KNN and, SVR for regression models were used in this research to predict the better AQI.


Introduction:

The Index of Air Quality called AQI is a daily worldwide assessment of air conditioning. API was founded in 1976 by American Environment department. This index was known as the Standards Index of pollution before its classification as the Air Quality Index (AQI) (PSI). The extremely critical characteristic of this value is that it offers credible information about state of the local air, how it might impact the wellbeing of people, and how to protect human health. The AQI measures a variety of contaminants, together with O3-(Ozone), co-(carbon monoxide), NO2-(nitrogen oxide), SO2-sulphur dioxide, PM2.5, and PM10 (particulate matter). Table 1 shows which gases are released (Kekulanadara et al., 2021).


Pollutant	Produced Sources:

PM2.5	- Power plants, automobiles, wood & agricultural burning.
PM10	- Dust and smoke 
CO	- Fuel burning, small-engines, heaters, fireplaces, gas-ranges. 
NO2	- Auto-mobiles, and power-plants
SO2	- fossil fuel incineration (coal & oil)
O3	- power-plants, industrial-boilers, & biological plants
