Air Quality Index Prediction By applying Machine Learning Procedures

ABSTRACT


Nowadays we can see the high air pollution in Metropolitan areas due to the heavy crowd staying, this is a serious issue. ozone, carbon-monoxide, nitrogen-oxide, sulphur-dioxide, particulate matter (2.5 & 1.0), and particulate matter-PM10 are causing polluting air, and it is released by actions done by people, fuel use, power & transportation. we use these molecules to identify the air quality index, to get this will use machine learning.
Most companies have started this process to help the environment. Machine Learning is the field to collect data from available sources and give the required output. In this paper, I have chosen this process to predict and forecast air quality values. Mainly I have used the supervised models for prediction, and time series model (prophet) used for forecasting. Linear-regression, Decision Tree, XG-Boost, KNN and, SVR for regression models were used in this research to predict the better AQI.
